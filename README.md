# 🎯 Interview Trainer Agent using IBM Watsonx

This project is an AI-powered Interview Trainer Agent built using (IBM Watsonx.ai). It is designed to simulate interview scenarios by answering user queries, helping job seekers prepare effectively for real interviews. The agent is capable of handling document-based questions, supports tool integration, and provides a realistic interaction environment similar to a human interviewer.



# 🚩 Problem Statement

Many candidates, especially freshers, struggle with (interview anxiety, lack of practice, and uncertainty about expected answers). Traditional preparation methods are often static, generic, or require human mentorship. This project aims to solve this by building an *intelligent agent that can conduct mock interviews, respond to custom prompts*, and help users practice in real time — anytime, anywhere.



# 🧰 Technologies Used

- *IBM Cloud** – Platform for hosting and deploying the agent  
- *Watsonx.ai Studio** – Core AI studio used to build and train the agent  
- *Cloud Object Storage** – For uploading and indexing documents  
- *Vector Indexing** – To allow document-based question-answering  
- *Foundation Model (Mistral-large)** – Base LLM model used  
- *Tool Integration** – Enabling additional functionalities like data access  
- *API Deployment** – To make the agent accessible for other platforms  
- *Markdown / GitHub** – Documentation and project tracking
